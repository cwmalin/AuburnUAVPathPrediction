  "body": "The goal of this project is to predict the path of an object based on its past behavior. It is being implemented using neural networks. It makes use of the numpy library.\r\n\r\nMy first attempt at the project was out of left field. It attempted to extend the idea of Neural Networks to networks with an infinite amount of input and hidden layer nodes. While mathematically interesting it didn't transfer over well to the real world. I was able to implement it, but due poor results I didn't bother continuing it.\r\n\r\nMy second attempt was very basic. I just used a vanilla feed forward network with back-propagation with 15 hidden nodes. It worked surprisingly well which told me that I wouldn't need to do anything particularly fancy to get this project to a satisfactory level. The average absolute error was\r\n\r\nMy third attempt was a recurrent neural network with a fixed input size (10 coordinate pairs) and fixed output size (1 coordinate pair). It also used back-propagation There was a significant reduction. The error was reduced to (13.3, 8.6)\r\n\r\nMy fourth attempt was another recurrent neural network with variable input size and a matching output size. For each input it tried to guess the next input and factored that into the back-propagation. There was another fairly significant drop in error to (7.8,6.2).\r\n\r\nI was pretty happy with this result. Though the networks could really use more testing on different data sets.",
